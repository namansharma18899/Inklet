# Inklet - A real-time Collaborative Text Editor üìù

> A robust backend system enabling real-time, multi-user collaborative text editing, powered by Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).

This project aims to explore and implement a scalable and resilient backend for a collaborative editor, ensuring seamless data synchronization and consistency across multiple clients.

---

## üéØ Core Objective

The primary goal is to design and implement a backend that leverages **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** to manage concurrent document edits. This involves a deep dive into CRDT mechanisms to ensure strong eventual consistency and a smooth user experience without complex server-side conflict resolution for every operation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously.
* **CRDT-based Synchronization:** Utilize CRDTs for merging concurrent edits without conflicts.
* **Eventual Consistency:** Ensure all users' views of the document eventually converge to the same state.
* **Scalable Connection Management:** Handle numerous concurrent client connections (e.g., via WebSockets).
* **Document Persistence:** Securely store and retrieve CRDT-based document states.

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Tech Stack

*(This section is a placeholder and can be adapted to your specific choices)*

* **Programming Language:** e.g., Go, Rust, Node.js (with TypeScript), Java, Python
* **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets
* **Caching (Optional):** Redis or similar for session management or hot document states
* **Database (for persistence):** PostgreSQL, Cassandra, or a document database suitable for CRDT structures.
* **Containerization (Optional):** Docker, Kubernetes

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture (High-Level)

The system will typically consist of:

1.  **Client Interface Layer:** Manages WebSocket connections from clients.
2.  **Session Management Service:** Tracks active users and document sessions.
3.  **CRDT Processing Engine:**
    * Receives operations from clients.
    * Applies operations to the server-side CRDT model of the document.
    * Broadcasts resulting CRDT operations to other clients in the same session.
4.  **Persistence Layer:** Saves and loads document states (CRDT snapshots or operation logs).

## üîç Areas for Deep Dive & Contribution

This project offers exciting challenges and opportunities for in-depth contributions, particularly in:

* **CRDT Selection & Implementation:**
    * Researching, selecting, and implementing appropriate CRDT algorithms for text (e.g., LSEQ, RGA, Logoot, Causal Trees) or other collaborative data structures.
    * Optimizing CRDT data structures and merge logic for performance and memory efficiency.
* **Real-time Operation Propagation:**
    * Designing robust and low-latency protocols for transmitting CRDT operations.
    * Handling message ordering, delivery guarantees, and potential network issues.
* **Ensuring & Verifying Eventual Consistency:**
    * Developing strategies and tools to test and verify the convergence properties of the CRDT implementation under various concurrent scenarios.
* **Scalable Server-Side Session & Document Management:**
    * Efficiently managing states for numerous active documents and collaborative sessions.
    * Designing strategies for sharding or distributing document load if necessary.
* **Optimized Persistence of CRDT State:**
    * Developing efficient methods for serializing, storing, and rehydrating CRDT-based document states, considering snapshotting vs. operation logging.
